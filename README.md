A TPO simulation tool made by HTML & JavaScript

Version: 0.1.0.0_alpha


## openTPO Help

Width of the test frame is locked at 1024 pixels. A minimum screen resolution of 1024x768 would ensure openTPO works correctly. Besides, we strongly recommend activating fullscreen mode by pressing F11 on your keyboard. Running openTPO in fullscreen mode would help to simulate the appearance of actual test.
Modes

There are three modes: test mode, practice mode, and review mode.

Test mode would simulate the actual process of the test, including all four parts in order: reading section, listening section, speaking section, and writing section. There would be a compulsory ten-minute break after listening section, like the actual test. Answers and responses will be saved automatically.

Practice mode splits an entire set of test into several parts. Apart from four sections mentioned above in the test mode, an individual reading passage or a specific task of speaking or writing could be selected as well. When the selected part finishes, a pop-up guide would guide returning to the "set select" page. New answers of the selected part will be saved.

Review mode compares your answer and correct answer of reading section and listening section in a chart, from which you can reach every question and see solutions. For the speaking and writing section, since there are no correct answer, the chart would contain only your responses.

In this version of openTPO, only reading section is available.

## Answers

This app could save answers automatically when a choice is selected. Since the webpage is unable to access a local file directly, openTPO puts practice history and responses in a sandbox managed by your browser. You SHOULD export these auto-save data to a file before cleaning browser history or uninstalling your browser. The reverse operation is to import auto-save data.

In this version of openTPO, importing and exporting are not supported. Clicking on Review mode button will show your answer and correct answer.

## Browser compatibility

Since openTPO harnesses a set of HTML5 traits, you should ensure that your browser supports them. The newest browsers barely cause any problems. If you have any problems running openTPO, updating browser should always be the first choice.

The highest version of IE on Windows XP do NOT support any HTML5 traits. Windows XP users should download other browsers.

Be sure to enable Javascript support in browser settings. Nearly all functions of openTPO are powered by Javascript.
