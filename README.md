# OpenTPO

OpenTPO is a simulator for test of Engligh for foreign languages, a useful tool for test-takers to prepare for the test.

Core Version: 0.2.1
Content Version: N/A

## It is...

* Free of charge

    Built on a webpage, OpenTPO is completely open-source and thus definitely free. (Now that you have the source code written by us developers, how could we charge you?) You do NOT have to pay some money to buy a similar TPO simulator on Taobao. You do NOT need any "crackers" anymore.

* Light-weighted and portable

    As long as your computer has the latest browser (e.g. IE10, Chrome, Firefox, etc.), OpenTPO can run with full functionality, needless to install a huge Java runtime library which would slow down your computer.

    OpenTPO itself is merely a webpage, which means you can run it everywhere: Windows, Mac, Linux, and even iPad. :)

* Keeping bug-free

    If you find error in contents or bugs of OpenTPO itself, report to us! We will soon solve the problem and add your name to the contributor list. If you are aware of how webpage works, forking OpenTPO repository on github.com and pulling requests or just submitting issues are both much acknowledged! How do you report a problem if using a "cracked" software?

## Contribute

* Report bugs

    Although constantly tested during development, we cannot guarantee OpenTPO is bug-free. We appreciate everyone who finds a bug. We believe that every bug is precious, no matter how little it is.

* Help with contents

    The development team has invited a marker language specifically for the reading passage to make it fairly easy. It would not take much time and effort to deal with an individual passage, as long as you have the text of passage and questions. Instructions of the marker language are written in wiki in the repository page on github.com

    Before starting with a passage, please be sure to email us and let us know which passage you choose to deal with. If someone has started with the one that you have chosen, we could inform you in time.


* Fork our project

    Since the source codes are entirely open to public, certainly we appreciate a lot if you submit a patch to the latest version of OpenTPO.

    Forking our project on github.com is a great way to help directly with the codes. We are looking forward to every forker!
