	'Groundwater||Groundwater is the word used to describe water that saturates the ground, filling all the available spaces. By far the most abundant type of groundwater is meteoric water; this is the groundwater that circulates as part of the water cycle. Ordinary meteoric water is water that has soaked into the ground from the surface, from precipitation (rain and snow) and from lakes and streams. There it remains, sometimes for long periods, before emerging at the surface again. At first thought it seems ##2incredible## that there can be enough space in the \"solid\" ground underfoot to hold all this water.``1||The necessary space is there, however, in many forms. The commonest spaces are those among the particlessand grains and tiny pebblesof loose, unconsolidated sand and gravel. Beds of this material, ##3out of sight## beneath the soil, are common. They are found wherever fast rivers carrying loads of coarse sediment once flowed. For example, as the great ice sheets that covered North America during the last ice age steadily melted away, huge volumes of water flowed from them. The water was always laden with pebbles, gravel, and sand, known as ##5glacial outwash##, that was deposited as the flow slowed down.``4||The same thing happens to this day, though on a smaller scale, wherever a sediment-laden river or stream emerges from a mountain valley onto relatively flat land, dropping its load as the current slows: the water usually spreads out fanwise, depositing the sediment in the form of a smooth, fan-shaped slope. Sediments are also dropped where a river slows on entering a lake or the sea, the deposited sediments are on a lake floor or the seafloor at first, but will be located inland at some future date, when the sea level falls or the land rises; such beds are sometimes thousands of meters thick.``6||In lowland country almost any spot on the ground may ##7overlie## what was once the bed of a river that has since become buried by soil; if they are now below the water\'s upper surface (the water table), the gravels and sands of the former riverbed, and its sandbars, will be saturated with groundwater.||##8So much for## unconsolidated sediments. Consolidated (or cemented) sediments, too, contain millions of minute water-holding pores. This is because the gaps among the original grains are often not totally ##9plugged## with cementing chemicals; also, parts of the original grains may become dissolved by percolating groundwater, either while consolidation is taking place or at any time afterwards. The result is that sandstone, for example, can be as porous as the loose sand from which it was formed.||Thus a proportion of the total volume of any sediment, loose or cemented, consists of empty space. Most crystalline rocks are much more solid; a common exception is basalt, a form of solidified volcanic lava, which is sometimes full of tiny bubbles that make it very porous.``10``11||The proportion of empty space in a rock is known as its porosity. But note that porosity is not the same as permeability, which measures the ease with which water can flow through a material; this depends on the sizes of the individual cavities and the crevices linking them.``10``11||Much of the water in a sample of water-saturated sediment or rock will drain from it if the sample is put in a suitable dry place. ^^13But some will remain, clinging to all solid surfaces. ^^13It is held there by the force of surface tension without which water would drain instantly from any wet surface, leaving it totally dry. ^^13The total volume of water in the saturated sample must therefore be thought of as consisting of water that can, and water that cannot, drain away. ^^13||The relative amount of these two kinds of water varies greatly from one kind of rock or sediment to another, even though their porosities may be the same. What happens depends on pore size. ##12If the pores are large, the water in them will exist as drops too heavy for surface tension to hold, and it will drain away; but if the pores are small enough, the water in them will exist as thin films, too light to overcome the force of surface tension holding them in place; then the water will be firmly held.##____1::1::Which of the following can be inferred from paragraph 1 about the ground that we walk on?::It cannot hold rainwater for long periods of time.||It prevents most groundwater from circulating.||It has the capacity to store large amounts of water.||It absorbs most of the water it contains from rivers.::3---1::1::The word ##incredible## in the passage is closest in meaning to::confusing||comforting||unbelievable||interesting::3---2::1::The word ##out of sight## in the passage is closest in meaning to::far away||hidden||partly visible||discovered::2---2::1::According to paragraph 2, where is groundwater usually found?::Inside pieces of sand and gravel||On top of beds of rock||In fast rivers that are flowing beneath the soil||In spaces between pieces of sediment::4---2::1::The phrase ##glacial outwash## in the passage refers to::Fast rivers||Glaciers||The huge volumes of water created by glacial melting||The particles carried in water from melting glaciers::4---3::1::All of the following are mentioned in paragraph 3 as places that sediment-laden rivers can deposit their sediments EXCEPT::A mountain valley||Flat land||A lake floor||The seafloor::1---4::1::The word ##overlie## in the passage is closest in meaning to::cover||change||separate||surround::1---5::1::The phrase ##so much for## in the passage is closest in meaning to::That is enough about||Now let us turn to||Of greater concern are||This is related to::1---5::1::The word ##plugged## in the passage is closet in meaning to::washed||dragged||filled up||soaked through::3---6::1::According to paragraphs 6 and 7, why is basalt unlike most crystalline forms of rock?::It is unusually solid.||It often has high porosity.||It has a low proportion of empty space.||It is highly permeable.::2---6::1::What is the main purpose of paragraph 7?::To explain why water can flow through rock||To emphasize the large amount of empty space in all rock||To point out that a rock cannot be both porous and permeable||To distinguish between two related properties of rock::4---9::1::Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage?

	'The Origins of Theater||In seeking to describe the origins of theater, one must rely primarily on speculation, since there is little concrete evidence on which to draw. The most widely accepted theory, ##1championed## by anthropologists in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, envisions theater as emerging out of myth and ritual. The process perceived by these anthropologists may be summarized briefly. During the early stages of its development, a society becomes aware of forces that appear to influence or control its food supply and well-being. Having little understanding of natural causes, it ##2attributes## both desirable and undesirable occurrences to supernatural or magical forces, and it searches for means to win the favor of these forces. Perceiving an apparent connection between certain actions performed by the group and the result it desires, the group repeats, refines and formalizes those actions into fixed ceremonies, or rituals.``3``4||Stories (myths) may then grow up around a ritual. Frequently the myths include representatives of those supernatural forces that the rites celebrate or hope to influence. Performers may wear costumes and masks to represent the mythical characters or supernatural forces in the rituals or in accompanying celebrations. As a people becomes more sophisticated, its conceptions of supernatural forces and causal relationships may change. As a result, it may abandon or modify some rites. But the myths that have grown up around the rites may continue as part of the group\'s oral tradition and may even come to be acted out under conditions divorced from these rites. When ##5this## occurs, the first step has been taken toward theater as an ##6autonomous## activity, and thereafter entertainment and aesthetic values may gradually replace the former mystical and socially efficacious concerns.``7||^^13Although origin in ritual has long been the most popular, it is by no means the only theory about how the theater came into being. ^^13Storytelling has been proposed as one alternative. ^^13Under this theory, relating and listening to stories are seen as fundamental human pleasures. ^^13Thus, the recalling of an event (a hunt, battle, or other feat) is elaborated through the narrator\'s pantomime and impersonation and eventually through each role being assumed by a different person.||A closely related theory sees theater as evolving out of dances that are primarily pantomimic, rhythmical or gymnastic, or from imitations of animal noises and sounds. Admiration for the performer\'s skill, virtuosity, and grace are seen as motivation for elaborating the activities into fully realized theatrical performances.||In addition to exploring the possible antecedents of theater, scholars have also theorized about the motives that led people to develop theater. Why did theater develop, and why was it valued after it ceased to fulfill the function of ritual? Most answers fall back on the theories about the human mind and basic human needs. One, set forth by Aristotle in the fourth century B.C., sees humans as naturally imitative—as taking pleasure in imitating persons, things, and actions and in seeing such imitations. Another, advanced in the twentieth century, suggests that humans have a gift for fantasy, through which they seek to reshape reality into more satisfying forms than those encountered in daily life. Thus, fantasy or fiction (of which drama is one form) permits people to objectify their anxieties and fears, confront them, and fulfill their hopes in fiction if not fact. The theater, then, is one tool whereby people define and understand their world or escape from unpleasant realities.``8``9||But neither the human imitative instinct nor a ##10penchant## for fantasy by itself leads to an autonomous theater. Therefore, additional explanations are needed. One necessary condition seems to be a somewhat detached view of human problems. For example, one sign of this condition is the appearance of the comic vision, since ##11comedy## requires sufficient detachment to view some deviations from social norms as ridiculous rather than as serious threats to the welfare of the entire group. Another condition that contributes to the development of autonomous theater is the emergence of the aesthetic sense. ##12For example, some early societies ceased to consider certain rites essential to their well-being and abandoned them, nevertheless, they retained as parts of their oral tradition the myths that had grown up around the rites and admired them for their artistic qualities rather than for their religious usefulness.##____1::1::The word ##championed## in the passage is closest in meaning to::changed||debated||created||supported::4---1::1::The word ##attributes## in the passage is closest in meaning to::ascribes||leaves||limits||contrasts::1---1::1::According to paragraph 1, theories of the origins of theater::Are mainly hypothetical||Are well supported by factual evidence||Have rarely been agreed upon by anthropologists||Were expressed in the early stages of theater\'s development::1---1::1::According to paragraph 1, why did some societies develop and repeat ceremonial actions?::To establish a positive connection between the members of the society||To help society members better understand the forces controlling their food supply||To distinguish their beliefs from those of other societies||To increase the society\'s prosperity::4---1::1::The word ##this## in the passage refers to::The acting out of rites||The divorce of ritual performers from the rest of society||The separation of myths from rites||The celebration of supernatural forces::3---2::1::The word ##autonomous## in the passage is closest in meaning to::artistic||important||independent||established::3---2::1::According to paragraph 2, what may cause societies to abandon certain rites?::Emphasizing theater as entertainment||Developing a new understanding of why events occur||Finding a more sophisticated way of representing mythical characters||Moving from a primarily oral tradition to a more written tradition::2---5::1::All of following are mentioned in paragraph 5 as possible reasons that led societies to develop theater EXCEPT::Theater allows people to face that they are afraid of.||Theater gives an opportunity to imagine a better reality.||Theater is a way to enjoy imitating other people.||Theater provides people the opportunity to better understand the human mind.::4---5::1::Which of the following best describes the organization of paragraph 5?::The author presents two theories for a historical phenomenon.||The author argues against theories expressed earlier in the passage.||The author argues for replacing older theories with a new one.||The author points out problems with two popular theories.::1---6::1::The word ##penchant## in the passage is closest in meaning to::compromise||inclination||tradition||respect::2---6::1::Why does the author mention ##comedy##?::To give an example of early types of theater||To explain how theater helps a society respond to threats to its welfare||To help explain why detachment is needed for the development of theater||To show how theatrical performers become detached from other members of society::3---6::1::Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage?

	'Timberline Vegetation on Mountains||The transition from forest to treeless tundra on a mountain slope is often a ##1dramatic## one. Within a vertical distance of just a few tens of meters, trees disappear as a life-form and are replaced by low shrubs, herbs, and grasses. This rapid zone of transition is called the upper timberline or tree line. In many semiarid areas there is also a lower timberline where the forest passes into steppe or desert at its lower edge, usually because of a lack of moisture.``2``3||The upper timberline, like the snow line, is highest in the tropics and lowest in the Polar Regions. It ranges from sea level in the Polar Regions to 4,500 meters in the dry subtropics and 3,500-4,500 meters in the moist tropics. Timberline trees are normally evergreens, suggesting that these have some advantage over deciduous trees (those that lose their leaves) in the extreme environments of the upper timberline. There are some areas, however, where broadleaf deciduous trees form the timberline. Species of birch, for example, may occur at the timberline in parts of the Himalayas.``4||At the upper timberline the trees begin to become twisted and deformed. This is particularly true for trees in the middle and upper latitudes, which tend to ##5attain## greater heights on ridges, whereas in the tropics the trees reach their greater heights in the valleys. This is because middle- and upper- latitude timberlines are strongly influenced by the duration and depth of the snow cover. As the snow is deeper and lasts longer in the valleys, trees tend to attain greater heights on the ridges, even though ##6they## are more exposed to high-velocity winds and poor, thin soils there. In the tropics, the valleys appear to be more favorable because they are less ##7prone## to dry out, they have less frost, and they have deeper soils.``8||There is still no universally agreed-on explanation for why there should be such a dramatic cessation of tree growth at the upper timberline. Various environmental factors may play a role. Too much snow, for example, can smother trees, and avalanches and snow creep can damage or destroy them. Late-lying snow reduces the effective growing season to the point where seedlings cannot establish themselves. ##9Wind velocity also increases with altitude and may cause serious stress for trees, as is made evident by the deformed shapes at high altitudes.## Some scientists have proposed that the presence of increasing levels of ultraviolet light with elevation may play a role, while browsing and grazing animals like the ibex may be another contributing factor. Probably the most important environmental factor is temperature, for if the growing season is too short and temperatures are too low, tree shoots and buds cannot mature sufficiently to survive the winter months.``10||Above the tree line there is a zone that is generally called alpine tundra. ^^12Immediately adjacent to the timberline, the tundra consists of a fairly complete cover of low-lying shrubs, herbs, and grasses, while higher up the number and diversity of species decrease until there is much bare ground with occasional mosses and lichens and some prostrate cushion plants. ^^12Some plants can even survive in favorable microhabitats above the snow line. The highest plants in the world occur at around 6,100 meters on Makalu in the Himalayas. ^^12At this great height, rocks, warmed by the sun, melt small snowdrifts. ^^12||The most striking characteristic of the plants of the alpine zone is their low growth form. This enables them to avoid the worst rigors of high winds and permits them to make use of the higher temperatures immediately adjacent to the ground surface. In an area where low temperatures are limiting to life, the importance of the additional heat near the surface is crucial. The low growth form can also permit the plants to take advantage of the insulation provided by a winter snow cover. In the equatorial mountains the low growth form is less prevalent.``11____1::1::The word ##dramatic## in the passage is closest in meaning to::gradual||complex||visible||striking::4---1::1::Where is the lower timberline mentioned in paragraph 1 likely to be found?::In an area that has little water||In an area that has little sunlight||Above a transition area||On a mountain that has on upper timberline::1---1::1::Which of the following can be inferred from paragraph 1 about both the upper and lower timberlines?::Both are treeless zones.||Both mark forest boundaries.||Both are surrounded by desert areas.||Both suffer from a lack of moisture.::2---2::1::Paragraph 2 supports which of the following statements about deciduous trees?::They cannot grow in cold climates.||They do not exist at the upper timberline.||They are less likely than evergreens to survive at the upper timberline.||They do not require as much moisture as evergreens do.::3---3::1::The word ##attain## in the passage is closest in meaning to::require||resist||achieve||endure::3---3::1::The word ##they## in the passage refers to::valleys||trees||heights||ridges::2---3::1::The word ##prone## in the passage is closest in meaning to::adapted||likely||difficult||resistant::2---3::1::According to paragraph 3, which of the following is true of trees in the middle and upper latitudes?::Tree growth is negatively affected by the snow cover in valleys.||Tree growth is greater in valleys than on ridges.||Tree growth on ridges is not affected by high-velocity winds.||Tree growth lasts longer in those latitudes than it does in the tropics.::1---4::1::Which of the sentences below best express the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage?

'The Origins of Cetaceans||It should be obvious that cetaceans-whales, porpoises, and dolphins-are mammals. They breathe through lungs, not through gills, and give birth to live young. Their streamlined bodies, the absence of hind legs, and the presence of a ***fluke---the two parts that constitute the large triangular tail of a whale*** and ***blowhole---a hole in the top of the head used for breathing*** cannot disguise their affinities with land dwelling mammals. However, unlike the cases of sea otters and pinnipeds (seals, sea lions, and walruses, whose limbs are functional both on land and at sea), it is not easy to envision what the first whales looked like. Extinct but already fully marine cetaceans are known from the fossil record. ^^12How was the gap between a walking mammal and a swimming whale bridged? ^^12Missing until recently were fossils clearly intermediate, or transitional, between land mammals and cetaceans.``1``2||^^12Very exciting discoveries have finally allowed scientists to reconstruct the most likely origins of cetaceans. ^^12In 1979, a team looking for fossils in northern Pakistan found what proved to be the oldest fossil whale. The fossil was officially named ++Pakicetus++ in honor of the country where the discovery was made. ++Pakicetus++ was found embedded in rocks formed from river deposits that were 52 million years old. The river that formed these deposits was actually not far from an ancient ocean known as the Tethys Sea.||The fossil consists of a complete skull of an archaeocyte, an extinct group of ancestors of modern cetaceans. Although limited to a skull, the ++Pakicetus++ fossil provides ##3precious## details on the origins of cetaceans. The skull is cetacean-like but its jawbones lack the enlarged space that is filled with fat or oil and used for receiving underwater sound in modern whales. ++Pakicetus++ probably detected sound through the ear opening as in land mammals. The skull also lacks a blowhole, another cetacean adaptation for diving. Other features, however, show experts that ++Pakicetus++ is a transitional form between a group of extinct flesh-eating mammals, the mesonychids, and cetaceans. It has been suggested that ++Pakicetus++ fed on fish in shallow water and was not yet adapted for life in the open ocean. ##5It## probably bred and gave birth on land.``4||Another major discovery was made in Egypt in 1989. Several skeletons of another early whale, ++Basilosaurus++, were found in sediments left by the Tethys Sea and now ##6exposed## in the Sahara desert. This whale lived around 40 million years ago, 12 million years after ++Pakicetus++. Many incomplete skeletons were found but they included, for the first time in an archaeocyte, a complete hind leg that features a foot with three tiny toes. Such legs would have been far too small to have supported the 50-foot-long ++Basilosaurus++ on land. ++Basilosaurus++ was undoubtedly a fully marine whale with possibly nonfunctional, or vestigial, hind legs.``7``8||An even more exciting find was reported in 1994, also from Pakistan. The now extinct whale ++Ambulocetus++ natans ("the walking whale that swam") lived in the Tethys Sea 49 million years ago. It lived around 3 million years after ++Pakicetus++ but 9 million before ++Basilosaurus++. The fossil ##9luckily## includes a good portion of the hind legs. The legs were strong and ended in long feet very much like those of a modern pinniped. The legs were certainly functional both on land and at sea. The whale retained a tail and lacked a fluke, the major means of locomotion in modern cetaceans. ##10The structure of the backbone shows, however, that ++Ambulocetus++ swam like modern whales by moving the rear portion of its body up and down, even though a fluke was missing.## The large hind legs were used for ##11propulsion## in water. On land, where it probably bred and gave birth, ++Ambulocetus++ may have moved around very much like a modern sea lion.

'Desert Formation||The deserts, which already occupy approximately a fourth of the Earth\'s land surface, have in recent decades been increasing at an alarming pace. The expansion of desertlike conditions into areas where they did not previously exist is called desertification. It has been estimated that an additional one-fourth of the Earth\'s land surface is ##1threatened## by this process. ||Desertification is accomplished primarily through the loss of stabilizing natural vegetation and the subsequent accelerated erosion of the soil by wind and water. In some cases the loose soil is blown completely away, leaving a stony surface. In other cases, the finer particles may be removed, while the sand-sized particles are accumulated to form mobile hills or ridges of sand.||Even in the areas that retain a soil cover, the reduction of vegetation typically results in the loss of the soil\'s ability to absorb substantial quantities of water. The impact of raindrops on the loose soil tends to transfer fine clay particles into the tiniest soil spaces, sealing them and producing a surface that allows very little water penetration. Water absorption is greatly reduced; consequently runoff is increased, resulting in accelerated erosion rates. The gradual drying of the soil caused by its diminished ability to absorb water results in the further loss of vegetation, so that a cycle of progressive surface deterioration is established.``2||In some regions, the increase in desert areas is occurring largely as the result of a trend toward drier climatic conditions. Continued gradual global warming has produced an increase in aridity for some areas over the past few thousand years. The process may be accelerated in subsequent decades if global warming resulting from air pollution seriously increases.||There is little doubt, however, that desertification in most areas results primarily from human activities rather than natural processes. The semiarid lands bordering the deserts exist in a ##3delicate## ecological balance and are limited in their potential to adjust to increased environmental pressures. Expanding populations are subjecting the land to increasing pressures to provide them with food and fuel. In wet periods, the land may be able to respond to these stresses. During the dry periods that are common phenomena along the desert margins, though, the pressure on the land is often far in excess of its diminished capacity, and desertification results.``4||Four specific activities have been identified as major contributors to the desertification processes: overcultivation, overgrazing, firewood gathering, and overirrigation. The cultivation of crops has expanded into ##5progressively## drier regions as population densities have grown. These regions are especially likely to have periods of severe dryness, so that crop failures are common. Since the raising of most crops necessitates the prior removal of the natural vegetation, crop failures leave extensive tracts of land ##7devoid of## a plant cover and susceptible to wind and water erosion. ``6||^^12The raising of livestock is a major economic activity in semiarid lands, where grasses are generally the dominant type of natural vegetation. ^^12The consequences of an excessive number of livestock grazing in an area are the reduction of the vegetation cover and the trampling and pulverization of the soil. ^^12This is usually followed by the drying of the soil and accelerated erosion. ^^12||Firewood is the chief fuel used for cooking and heating in many countries. The increased pressures of expanding populations have led to the removal of woody plants so that many cities and towns are surrounded by large areas completely lacking in trees and shrubs. The increasing use of dried animal waste as a substitute fuel has also hurt the soil because this valuable soil conditioner and source of plant nutrients is no longer being returned to the land.||The final major human cause of desertification is soil salinization resulting from overirrigation. Excess water from irrigation sinks down into the water table. If no drainage system exists, the water table rises, bringing dissolved salts to the surface. The water evaporates and the salts are left behind, creating a white crustal layer that prevents air and water from reaching the underlying soil.``8``9||##10The extreme seriousness of desertification results from the vast areas of land and the tremendous numbers of people affected, as well as from the great difficulty of reversing or even slowing the process.## Once the soil has been removed by erosion, only the passage of centuries or millennia will enable new soil to form. In areas where considerable soil still remains, though, a rigorously enforced program of land protection and cover-crop planting may make it possible to reverse the present deterioration of the surface.``11____1::1::The word ##threatened## in the passage is closest in meaning to::restricted||endangered||prevented||rejected::2---::1::According to paragraph 3, the loss of natural vegetation has which of the following consequences for soil?::Increased stony content||Reduced water absorption||Increased numbers of spaces in the soil||Reduced water runoff::2---5::1::The word ##delicate## in the passage is closest in meaning to::fragile||predictable||complex||valuable::1---5::1::According to paragraph 5, in dry periods, border areas have difficulty::Adjusting to stresses created by settlement||Retaining their fertility after desertification||Providing water for irrigating crops||Attracting populations in search of food and fuel::1---6::1::The word ##progressively## in the passage is closest in meaning to::openly||impressively||objectively||increasingly::4---6::1::According to paragraph 6, which of the following is often associated with raising crops?::Lack of proper irrigation techniques||Failure to plant crops suited to the particular area||Removal of the original vegetation||Excessive use of dried animal waste::3---6::1::The phrase ##devoid of## in the passage is closest in meaning to::consisting of||hidden by||except for||lacking in::4---9::1::According to paragraph 9, the ground\'s absorption of excess water is a factor in desertification because it can::Interfere with the irrigation of land||Limit the evaporation of water ||Require more absorption of air by the soil||Bring salts to the surface::4---9::1::All of the following are mentioned in the passage as contributing to desertification EXCEPT::Soil erosion||Global warming||Insufficient irrigation||The raising of livestock::3---10::1::Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage?

'Early Cinema||The cinema did not emerge as a form of mass consumption until its technology evolved from the initial "peepshow" format to the point where images were projected on a screen in a darkened theater. In the peepshow format, a film was viewed through a small opening in a machine that was created for that purpose. Thomas Edison\'s peepshow device, the Kinetoscope, was introduced to the public in 1894. It was designed for use in Kinetoscope parlors, or arcades, which contained only a few individual machines and permitted only one customer to view a short, 50-foot film at any one time. The first Kinetoscope parlors contained five machines. For the price of 25 cents (or 5 cents per machine), customers moved from machine to machine to watch five different films (or, in the case of famous prizefights, successive rounds of a single fight).``1||These Kinetoscope arcades were modeled on phonograph parlors, which had proven successful for Edison several years earlier. In the phonograph parlors, customers listened to recordings through individual ear tubes, moving from one machine to the next to hear different recorded speeches or pieces of music. The Kinetoscope parlors functioned in a similar way. Edison was more interested in the sale of Kinetoscopes (for roughly $1,000 apiece) to these parlors than in the films that would be run in them (which cost approximately $10 to $15 each). ##3He refused to develop projection technology, reasoning that if he made and sold projectors, then exhibitors would purchase only one machine-a projector-from him instead of several.##``2||^^12Exhibitors, however, wanted to maximize their profits, which they could do more ##4readily## by projecting a handful of films to hundreds of customers at a time (rather than one at a time) and by charging 25 to 50 cents admission. ^^12About a year after the opening of the first Kinetoscope parlor in 1894, showmen such as Louis and Auguste Lumiere, Thomas Armat and Charles Francis Jenkins, and Orville and Woodville Latham (with the ##5assistance## of Edison\'s former assistant, William Dickson) perfected projection devices. ^^12These early projection devices were used in vaudeville theaters, legitimate theaters, local town halls, makeshift storefront theaters, fairgrounds, and amusement parks to show films to a mass audience. ^^12||With the advent of projection in 1895-1896, motion pictures became the ultimate form of mass consumption. Previously, large audiences had viewed spectacles at the theater, where vaudeville, popular dramas, musical and minstrel shows, classical plays, lectures, and slide-and-lantern shows had been presented to several hundred spectators at a time. But the movies differed significantly from these other forms of entertainment, which depended on either live performance or (in the case of the slide-and-lantern shows) the active involvement of a master of ceremonies who assembled the final program.``6||Although early exhibitors regularly accompanied movies with live acts, the substance of the movies themselves is mass-produced, prerecorded material that can easily be reproduced by theaters with little or no active participation by the exhibitor. Even though early exhibitors shaped their film programs by mixing films and other entertainments together in whichever way they thought would be most attractive to audiences or by accompanying them with lectures, their creative control remained limited. What audiences came to see was the technological marvel of the movies; the lifelike reproduction of the commonplace motion of trains, of waves striking the shore, and of people walking in the street; and the magic made possible by trick photography and the manipulation of the camera.``7||With the advent of projection, the viewer\'s relationship with the image was no longer private, as it had been with earlier peepshow devices such as the Kinetoscope and the Mutoscope, which was a similar machine that reproduced motion by means of successive images on individual photographic cards instead of on strips of celluloid. ##9It## suddenly became public-an experience that the viewer shared with dozens, scores, and even hundreds of others. At the same time, the image that the spectator looked at ##11expanded## from the minuscule peepshow dimensions of 1 or 2 inches (in height) to the life-size proportions of 6 or 9 feet.``8``10____1::1::According to paragraph 1, all of the following were true of viewing films in Kinetoscope parlors EXCEPT::One individual at a time viewed a film.||Customers could view one film after another.||Prizefights were the most popular subjects for films.||Each film was short.::3---2::1::The author discusses phonograph parlors in paragraph 2 in order to::Explain Edison\'s financial success||Describe the model used to design Kinetoscope parlors||Contrast their popularity to that of Kinetoscope parlors||Illustrate how much more technologically advanced Kinetoscope parlors were::2---2::1::Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence from the passage?
